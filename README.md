# Audio_Classification_with_TensorFlow

Audio classification usually does not get the same kind of attention as image classification with deep learning this could be because audio processing that is typically used in such scenarios is not as straight forward as image data.
Using Deep Learning a model is created and trained to learn to classify audio files.
